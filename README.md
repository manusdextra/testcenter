# Testcenter

This was my first attempt at building an interactive application using the Flask microframework for Python.

I started off using Miguel Grinberg's tutorial, but quickly decided that I wanted to focus on something more personal. At this point, I had been teaching for some time, and wanted a tool I could use to easily track my student's progress using the material provided by our coursebooks.

My long term goal was to implement something akin to Kahoot, with a focus on more easily adding/converting material (at this point I didn't know you could upload .XLSx files), and something that I could in future expand to other task types beside multiple choice. I thought this could be a good way to practice a variety of different applications, while still having a clear roadmap in the form of, for example, Cambridge English exams.

I learned about templating, SQL and ORMs, and forms through this project. I eventually realised that I would need something more interactive to implement the Admin panel I had started working on, and put the project on hold to go and learn more Javascript.
